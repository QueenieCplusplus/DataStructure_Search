# Binary Search Tree
搜索樹(二元搜索樹)

Binary Search Tree is for a static set of ids. That is, we make no additons to or deletions from the set. Only searches are performed.

A sorted file can be searched using a Binary Tree.


                              if
                             /  \
                           do    return

>>>

                              for 
                             /  \
                           do    while

To find an optimal binary search tree for a given static file, we shall decide on a cost measure for this tree.

When searching for an id at level q, function search makes q iteratins of the for loop.
